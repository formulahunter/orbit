        GUI layout notes

        as of now the intent is to use (at least some) HTML elements for the GUI
        (rendering text in the canvas is known to be slow and may prove
        challenging to combine with WebGL rendering anyway).

        if this remains true, consider nesting GUI components and the <canvas>
        element in two separate <div>s and overlay them so that GUI elements are
        positioned on top of the canvas. pay particular attention to how this
        will work across devices. CSS styling will have to be on point to make
        sure they always align properly.
